For lab2, only the simple_list, hash_set, digests and main files are
of interest.

A HashSet type data structure is provided for storing constants and atoms
in the SymbolTable. The implementation uses a user-defined number of buckets,
values which defaults to 37, with linked lists for storing values.

"digests" modules provides digest functions for floats and strings; for
integers, their vlaue is used as digest. Only integers, strings and floats
are supported in current implementation.

The insertion alorithm assigns to any value the bucket with index
digest_of_val % bucket_count. Duplicates are not allowed in any given
linked list.

The get algorithm simply checks if the "digest_of_val % bucket_count"
indexed bucket contains the queried key. implementation leverages that
the underlying SimpleList object returns None if key is not contained.
